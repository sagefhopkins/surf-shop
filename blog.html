            <h3>
                July 2020 - Locals: Be Nice!
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is a public service announcement. If you live near a wave, read on...
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>
                Especially in these weird times: Be Nice!
            </h5>
            <p>Yesterday, I posted this on Instagram:</p>
            <div class="quote">
                "It's been a while. For friends and family. For locals. It's also been a while
                for strangers. For anyone who lives near a wave, let's try to be patient and 
                open to travelling surfers. Corona is still around, but so are the anxieties and
                challenges that we all shrug off in the sea.
                #inthistogether"
            </div>
            <p>
                I left out why I felt the need to say it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've been following the blog, you'll already know how I feel about localism.
                And now that I live near a beach, I want to talk about it from a 'local' perspective.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>
                What's your excuse?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Last week, surfing at my local spot (before you jump on me, it's been cleared by our government and
                I've only been out three times in 4 months) I got talking to guy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turns out he'd driven for a few hours to get to the spot. But he wasn't local. He wasn't even a bit local!
                I filled up with a mix of weird emotions. Confusion, anger, intrigue... Why was he here, miles from home?
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I asked another question he told me it was the first time he'd been able to get in the water for months.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it was the first time he'd been out since his wife died 10 days ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a split second, everything I'd been feeling was replaced by guilt.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>
                Who am I to judge?
            </h5>
            <p>
                I've already been really open about how stupid I think localism is. But here I was, judging
                this guy because of where I live.
            </p>
            <p>
                And am I really that judgemental? Does it really take someone's death for me to "allow" good feelings about
                a traveling surfer?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I'm glad to say it woke me up.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter what people are going through - the death of a close one, anxiety from social distancing or just the 
                need for a lung full of sea air - they are just as deserving as time in the water as we are.
            </p>
            <p>
                So next time you see someone you don't recognize at your spot, ask yourself...what makes you more deserving than the
                next person to be out in the waves?
